## Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

#The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations
#or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  
#
#One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

#Here are the data for the project:

#
# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

#set working directory to the location where the UCI HAR Dataset was unzipped
setwd('/Users/spraman/Code/Cousera/DataScience/GettingAndCleaningData/CourseProject/Source//');

# Read in the data from files
features     = read.table('./features.txt',header=FALSE); #imports features.txt
activityType = read.table('./activity_labels.txt',header=FALSE); #imports activity_labels.txt
subjectTrain = read.table('./train/subject_train.txt',header=FALSE); #imports subject_train.txt
xTrain       = read.table('./train/x_train.txt',header=FALSE); #imports x_train.txt
yTrain       = read.table('./train/y_train.txt',header=FALSE); #imports y_train.txt

# Assigin column names to the data imported above
colnames(activityType)  = c('activityId','activityType');
colnames(subjectTrain)  = "subjectId";
colnames(xTrain)        = features[,2]; 
colnames(yTrain)        = "activityId";

# cCreate the final training set by merging yTrain, subjectTrain, and xTrain
trainingData = cbind(yTrain,subjectTrain,xTrain);

# Read in the test data
subjectTest = read.table('./test/subject_test.txt',header=FALSE); #imports subject_test.txt
xTest       = read.table('./test/x_test.txt',header=FALSE); #imports x_test.txt
yTest       = read.table('./test/y_test.txt',header=FALSE); #imports y_test.txt

# Assign column names to the test data imported above
colnames(subjectTest) = "subjectId";
colnames(xTest)       = features[,2]; 
colnames(yTest)       = "activityId";


# Create the final test set by merging the xTest, yTest and subjectTest data
testData = cbind(yTest,subjectTest,xTest);


# Combine training and test data to create a final data set
finalData = rbind(trainingData,testData);

# Create a vector for the column names from the finalData, which will be used
# to select the desired mean() & stddev() columns
colNames  = colnames(finalData); 


## Section 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

# Create a logicalVector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean() & stddev() columns and FALSE for others
logicalVector = (grepl("activity..",colNames) | grepl("subject..",colNames) | grepl("-mean..",colNames) & !grepl("-meanFreq..",colNames) & !grepl("mean..-",colNames) | grepl("-std..",colNames) & !grepl("-std()..-",colNames));

# Subset finalData table based on the logicalVector to keep only desired columns
finalData = finalData[logicalVector==TRUE];


# Merge the finalData set with the acitivityType table to include descriptive activity names
finalData = merge(finalData,activityType,by='activityId',all.x=TRUE);

# Updating the colNames vector to include the new column names after merge
colNames  = colnames(finalData); 

## Section 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

# Cleaning up the variable names
for (i in 1:length(colNames)) 
{
  colNames[i] = gsub("\\()","",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("-std$","StdDev",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("-mean","Mean",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("^(t)","time",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("^(f)","freq",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("([Gg]ravity)","Gravity",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("([Bb]ody[Bb]ody|[Bb]ody)","Body",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("[Gg]yro","Gyro",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("AccMag","AccMagnitude",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("([Bb]odyaccjerkmag)","BodyAccJerkMagnitude",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("JerkMag","JerkMagnitude",colNames[i])
  colNames[i] = gsub("GyroMag","GyroMagnitude",colNames[i])
};

# Reassigning the new descriptive column names to the finalData set
colnames(finalData) = colNames;

## Section 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Create a new table, finalDataNoActivityType without the activityType column
finalDataNoActivityType  = finalData[,names(finalData) != 'activityType'];

# Summarizing the finalDataNoActivityType table to include just the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject
tidyData    = aggregate(finalDataNoActivityType[,names(finalDataNoActivityType) != c('activityId','subjectId')],by=list(activityId=finalDataNoActivityType$activityId,subjectId = finalDataNoActivityType$subjectId),mean);

# Merging the tidyData with activityType to include descriptive acitvity names
tidyData    = merge(tidyData,activityType,by='activityId',all.x=TRUE);

# Export the tidyData set 
write.table(tidyData, file = "tidayData.csv", sep = ",", col.names = NA,
qmethod = "double")
